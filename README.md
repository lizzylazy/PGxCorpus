# PGxCorpus

PGxCorpus is a manually annotated corpus, designed for the extraction of pharmacogenomic realtions from text. 
It is composed of 945 sentences mannually annotated, issued from 911 distinct PubMed abstracts. 
Annotation has been achieved by 11 annotators, including 5 senior annotators. 
Each sentence has been seen independently by 2 annotators, in a first phase, and by a third senior annotator, in a second phase.  

* PGxCorpus is in the file [PGxCorpus.tar](PGxCorpus.tar), in the Brat file format. 
* It can be browsed on our Brat server at https://pgxcorpus.loria.fr/.
* It is also available on [FigShare](https://figshare.com/s/9d315cec6bb629d04210).

## Annotation guidelines

The annotation guidelines were provided to the annotators to reduced the heterogeneity in the annotation task.
